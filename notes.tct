Tony's data was considerably short on day 1

my data (edited) used ChatGPT and some speed hysteresis to get as close as possible, but I couldn't find anything to match time perfectly.

ChatGPT Speed Hysteresis params:

# Coarse hysteresis parameters (global)
TAU = 5.0               # seconds (EMA smoothing)
V_STOP = 0.050          # m/s (enter stop at/under this, after T_STOP)
V_MOVE = 0.060          # m/s (exit stop above this, after T_MOVE)
T_STOP = 20.0           # seconds persistence to enter stop
T_MOVE = 20.0           # seconds persistence to exit stop

App got data from Day 1 good, but day 2 and three had to be manually reconstructed.

note to self, checkpoints need to be double checked for where Zach actually marks them. At the track break or at the actual physical location of the trucks
do we need to cut out when they slow down for CPs or only the actual stopped time? it makes a difference of multiple mminutes

there may be CSV data still in the app's storage, but idk how to get it at the moment. Need a way to view the size of csv storage boxes and pick out the large ones, if they exist.
otherwise get GPS data from Gaia from dad

track total timing seems to be similar to what Gaia reported as the "total moving time"

Zach says he uses an algorithm in Excel to clean the data.

App improvements:
offline map
elevation "ticker" that shows upcoming elevation changes
3D map??
allow everyone to connect and place markers on the map
waypoint placement/display
web version


if a checkpoint lands on a "removed" point with time delta of 0, the app crashes/doesnt save data properly. space out "removed points" by some time t > 0
